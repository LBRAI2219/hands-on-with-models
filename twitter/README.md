# About this module	

This Twitter module was thought and design by Anne Osterrieder ([@AnneOsterrieder]()), from Oxford Brooke University. The module was used in the framework of a biotechnology course. I has been implemented these last three years. 

This year, the group participating into the biotechnology twitter are:

- [@BiotechBugle]()
- [@BioQuizzical]()

All hte material from this module are coming from Anne and we would like to warmly thank her for that.
